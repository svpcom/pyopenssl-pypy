Only the .tex format documentation is original,
because the others are derived from it, so don't
edit them directly.  To build the other formats
use a command of ...

  make all


To build the documentation you will need to have
latex2html and lynx installed.  On Fedora both can
be obtained with ...

  sudo yum install latex2html lynx

Or on Debian or Ubuntu ...

  sudo apt-get install latex2html lynx
